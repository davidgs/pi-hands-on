## Welcome to the Workshop

### Overview

We will be building a Raspberry Pi (model 4B) from scratch, then using a [Zymkey](https://zymbit.com/zymkey) to secure it by encrypting the `rootfs` root filesystem. We will use [Bootware](https://zymbit.com/bootware) to create a new partition map.

We will also enable A/B partitioning to make updates resilient, reliable, and recoverable in the event of a bad update.

```python
print(this is bs)
```

```bash
sudo apt update
```
