## Background

The venerable Raspberry Pi has been around for over a decade (officially created in 2009) and it has become a standard in many robotics, home automation, and other types of uses. Especially for “makers” and other tinkerers. But it has also made serious inroads into the professional and enterprise world – just more quietly.

It’s a capable, reliable, and powerful Single Board Computer (SBC) with a robust user community. For all it’s strengths, it does have a few notable weaknesses. The biggest one is security. Not because the SBC itself is insecure. and not because the Operating System (OS) is insecure (it runs Linux, which can be very well secured). The most vulnerable part of the Raspberry Pi is the fact that it boots and runs off of a micro SD card.



### Lots to cover

Clearly we're going to cover a lot of ground, but in the end you'll have a Raspberry Pi that is secure from physical tampering making it virtually impossible to steal your programs and data, remotely updateable in a secure, recoverable fashion, and able to transmit data securely.

So let's get started!
